                     //we have to add bootstrap links in index.html inside public folder
                     //we make components in folder in src and then combine them in app.js  //components like navbar, form , footerdesign etc
                     //components first letter is always capital
                     //inside html we write javascript inside inside {};

               //to transfer data bw two modeules in app.js


    
                            module 1: 
                                   const a = "ashish";
                                   const b = "rohan";
                                   const c = "shivam";
                                    export default a; // can be accessed by any name in module 2;
                                    export {b};        //only accessed by this name only.
                                    export {c};
                    
                            module 2:
                              import  dz , {b,c} from './module2.mjs'
                              console.log(dz);   //output default value ie. ashish;
                              console.log b; // output the given variable value i.e rohan;
            

4.Props:
     . props are use to render element data name (title ,) from app.js file to dedicated component.
     . here we can use compnnents multiple times using prop feature to pass title name from app.js .

       inside app.js:

       <Navbar title="ashish" ></Navbar>

       inside navbar component:
             
                export default function Navbar(props) {
                    <a className="navbar-brand" href="/">{props.title}</a>
                }


        //proptypes and default props:

              //proptypes: 
                          to set type of prop received by component we set proptypes.

                          Navbar.propTypes={
                            title:PropTypes.string.isrequired,         //isrequired pass error if not found
                            abouteText:PropTypes.string
                         }

              //default props:
                          if we do not set any proptype in app.jx then which prop is used in place of it. 
                     
       
                          Navbar.defaultProps={
                            title:'set title here',
                            aboutText:'About text here'
                         }
                    

5.States:
       .state is use for particular components.
       .we have to make handleonchanage func with it.
       .Hooks - as react is a function based, and to use class properteis inside function we use hooks. it is a react functionality.
               . there are several types of hooks in react:
                   1. useState


       //state are imported throgh React
                 ie:
                 //inside component:
            step1:      .import React,{useState} from 'react'.

            step2:   
                    const[text,setText] =useState(0);  //here text is render variable and inside setText we set the value.  //we change the value of text using setText variable.
       
            step3:
                  make a on click func, and a on change funct in textbox.


6. Router:
 
                    //to move from one page to another without reloading the page we use react Router Dom.
                    //search google react router dom.
                    //
